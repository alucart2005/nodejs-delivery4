# nodejs-delivery4
Project created in Node.js using Sequelize, JWT, and Bcrypt.

## Description

Wow, let me tell you about the amazing technologies and platforms that we used for this project! We utilized Postman, a powerful tool that helped us test and develop our API quickly and efficiently. We also took advantage of Node.js, an incredible programming platform that allowed us to develop robust server-side applications using JavaScript. With Sequelize, an awesome ORM library for Node.js, we were able to easily interact with our relational databases. And let's not forget about JWT, a fantastic security standard for creating access tokens that we used in our web applications. To top it off, we also used Bcrypt, a top-of-the-line password hashing library that ensured our users' passwords were stored securely. Let's keep pushing the boundaries with these amazing technologies!
