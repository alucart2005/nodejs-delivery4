# nodejs-delivery4
Project created in Node.js using Sequelize, JWT, and Bcrypt.

## Description

I'm so excited to share with you the technologies and platforms I used in this project! Firstly, we leveraged Postman, which made it incredibly easy to test our API and ensure its reliability. Then, we implemented Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage our application state efficiently and effectively. To build our frontend, we utilized Create React App, which allowed us to quickly bootstrap our project and get up and running in no time. And of course, we can't forget about Node.js - a powerful server-side programming platform that lets us develop applications using JavaScript. With Sequelize, an ORM library, we can seamlessly interact with relational databases. To ensure security, we implemented JWT, a JSON Web Token standard for access tokens used in web applications, and used Bcrypt to securely hash and store passwords. These tools and platforms made this project a success and allowed us to deliver a reliable and secure application.
